## Why migrate plugins?
Some plugins are no longer maintained by their original authors, and may cause performance hiccups dur to their outdated (sometimes 3+ years old) code. Aliucord Gradle Plugin v2 introduced really big performance improvements, by migrating these plugins to the new system, we can make sure they run smoothly on every device. Sorry for yapping so much lol.
